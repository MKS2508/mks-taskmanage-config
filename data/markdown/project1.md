## Code Example

\`\`\`javascript
// Task model
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    trim: true
  },
  priority: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['High', 'Medium', 'Low'],
    default: 'Medium'
  },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['Not Started', 'In Progress', 'Completed'],
    default: 'Not Started'
  },
  dueDate: {
    type: Date
  },
  createdBy: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    required: true
  },
  assignedTo: [{
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User'
  }],
  project: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Project'
  },
  tags: [{
    type: String,
    trim: true
  }],
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  updatedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
});

const Task = mongoose.model('Task', taskSchema);

module.exports = Task;
