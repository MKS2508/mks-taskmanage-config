# MKS IPTV 

## Project Overview

This is a SwiftUI-based IPTV client application that supports multiple Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS). The app allows users to browse and stream movies, TV series, and live channels from an IPTV service.

## Architecture

The project follows an MVVM architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Data structures for movies, series, live channels, and categories
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management (MediaListViewModel, DownloadManager, etc.)
- **Views**: SwiftUI views with platform-specific implementations
- **Services**: Network layer (MovieService) for API communication
- **Core**: Shared utilities like networking, configuration, and caching

Key architectural patterns:

- Platform-specific views using conditional compilation (#if os(iOS), etc.)
- Shared ViewModels across platforms
- Centralized configuration in IPTVConfiguration
- Download management system with local HTTP server for streaming
